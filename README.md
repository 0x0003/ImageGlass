## üõ£ Development progress & Roadmap
ImageGlass 9.0 is the biggest update ever, supports ***hardware acceleration*** and many more. I have been rewriting the entire app for months.
- [Version 9.0 beta 1](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/releases/tag/9.0.1.514) was already released. Try it and let me know your feedback.
- [Version 9.0 beta 2](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/projects/12) is under develpoment.
- There will be a few more beta releases before version 9.0 reaches stable state. In the meanwhile, you can still enjoy the new updates of version 8.x.

ImageGlass 9 uses [.NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/). If you are unable to install .NET 6, you can stay with the version 8.

## üíñ This project needs your help!
ImageGlass Kobe is free and open source but developing it has taken thousands of hours of my time and a large part of my sanity. If you feel this little viewer is useful to you, it would go a great way to ensure that I can afford to take the time to continue to develop it.

Thanks for your gratitude and financial help!
